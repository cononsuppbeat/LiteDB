# How to Play Armies of Exigo in Widescreen Resolution
 
Armies of Exigo is a fantasy real-time strategy game that was released in 2004 by Black Hole Entertainment and Electronic Arts. The game features a unique gameplay mechanic where the battles take place both above and below the ground, allowing for different strategies and tactics. However, the game was designed for 4:3 aspect ratio monitors, which means that playing it on modern widescreen displays can result in distorted graphics and interface.

## Download and Install the Widescreen Patch
 
One of the easiest ways to play Armies of Exigo in widescreen resolution is to download and install a widescreen patch created by jackfuste[^1^]. This patch modifies the game's executable file to add support for 1920x1080 resolution, which is the most common widescreen resolution nowadays. To use this patch, follow these steps:

2. Extract the archive and copy the modified exe file to your Armies of Exigo installation folder, replacing the original one.
3. Launch the game and select 1920x1080 resolution from the options menu.

That's it! You should now be able to play Armies of Exigo in widescreen resolution without any graphical glitches or interface problems.
 
## Modify the Game Files for Custom Resolution
 
If you want to play Armies of Exigo in a different widescreen resolution than 1920x1080, you will need to modify some of the game files manually. This method requires some hex editing skills and a backup of your original files, so proceed with caution. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Download a hex editor such as [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/).
2. Open your Armies of Exigo installation folder and make a backup copy of AoE.exe file.
3. Open AoE.exe file with HxD and search for the following hex values: 80 02 00 00 E0 01 00 00. These values correspond to 640x480 resolution.
4. Replace these values with your desired resolution in hex format. For example, if you want to play in 1440x900 resolution, you need to replace them with A0 05 00 00 84 03 00 00.
5. Save the file and close HxD.
6. Launch the game and select your custom resolution from the options menu.

Note that this method may not work for all resolutions and may cause some graphical issues or crashes. If you encounter any problems, restore your backup file and try a different resolution or use the widescreen patch instead.
