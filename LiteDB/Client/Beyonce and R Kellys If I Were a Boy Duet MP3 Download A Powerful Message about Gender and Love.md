BeyoncÃ© and R. Kelly have never publicly commented on their duet version of If I Were A Boy, nor have they performed it live together. The remix was reportedly done without BeyoncÃ©'s knowledge or consent, and was leaked online by R. Kelly's camp. Some fans speculated that BeyoncÃ© was unhappy with the remix and did not want to be associated with R. Kelly, especially after his infamous interview with Gayle King in 2019, where he denied all the allegations of sexual abuse against him.
 
However, some fans also pointed out that BeyoncÃ© and R. Kelly have collaborated before on other songs, such as The Closer I Get To You (2003), a cover of Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway's classic duet, and Fiesta (Remix) (2001), a hit single by R. Kelly featuring Jay-Z and Boo & Gotti. BeyoncÃ© has also expressed her admiration for R. Kelly's music in the past, calling him "the king of R&B" in a 2004 interview with MTV News.
 
The duet between BeyoncÃ© and R. Kelly is one of the many examples of how music can bring together artists from different backgrounds, genres, and eras, and create something new and unexpected. It is also a testament to the power and influence of BeyoncÃ© and R. Kelly, who have both shaped the sound and culture of R&B for decades.
